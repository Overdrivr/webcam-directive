# Configure

```
npm install
```

Set `CHROME_BIN` ENV variable to point to the `chrome.exe` application.

On Windows, with the default path you should type
```
SET CHROME_BIN=C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
```
(Please note that no `""` where used, they seem to cause trouble with Karma.
Just paste the path as-is, even if it has spaces)
